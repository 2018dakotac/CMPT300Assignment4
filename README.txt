UNixLs will emulate the ls function with select flags on no sorting
flags can be in any combination/order but must come before directory names
static date format will be used 

ls flags that will be implemented are -i, -l, -R

-i, print the index number of each file
-l, use a long listing format
-R, list subdirectories recursively
